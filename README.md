Introduction
This repository demonstrates how to create logical gates, such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XOR, using deep learning techniques. The goal is to showcase the progression from building a neural network for logical gates from scratch to utilizing advanced libraries like TensorFlow .


To run the implementations, you'll need the following:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow  
NumPy
Install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib
For TensorFlow:



Basic Logical Gates Implementation

Implement basic logical gates (AND, OR, NOT) using a neural network from scratch.
NAND and NOR Gates Implementation

Implement NAND and NOR gates using the previously created neural network.
XOR Gate Implementation

Implement XOR gate using a multi-layer neural network.
Advanced Libraries Implementation

Implement logical gates using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Usage
Each implementation has a dedicated file in the src/ directory. Run the desired file to create and visualize the logical gate. For example:
