#Deep Learning-based Logical Gates Construction

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and implementation for creating various types of logical gates using a deep learning approach, starting from scratch and progressing to using advanced libraries.


Introduction:

This repository demonstrates how to create logical gates, such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XOR, using deep learning approch. The goal is to showcase the progression from building a neural network for logical gates from scratch to utilizing advanced libraries like TensorFlow .


To run the implementations, you'll need the following:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow  
NumPy
Install the required packages using pip:


Basic Logical Gates Implementation

Implement basic logical gates (AND, OR, NOT) using a neural network from scratch.
NAND and NOR Gates Implementation

Implement NAND and NOR gates using the previously created neural network.
XOR Gate Implementation

Implement XOR gate using a multi-layer neural network.
Advanced Libraries Implementation

Implement logical gates using TensorFlow .

Feel free to use the code provided in this repository for your projects.
